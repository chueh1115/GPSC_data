TOU
#calculation: from In_situ_DO_flux (mmol O2/m2/d) to carbon unit(mg C/m2/d)
#mmolO2 -> mgO2:  33.191  mgO2/mmolO2 
#mgO2 -> mgC   :  0.309   mgC/mgO2  
TOU=In_situ_DO_flux*(-1)*33.191*0.309

(p27)This can lead to the perception that you focus only on phytodetritus, and neglect terrestrial OM transported via gravity flow).
從定義上說是，但是依照目前model的structure來說我們沒有特別區分沉積物OM來源

Eq. 7 seems to be wrong. ->see ppt
LIM equaation: E, A, G (流量方向的矩陣)

(p35). For example, if the straight pathway was 10 and FCI=0.5, meaning that an average unit of inflow travels 15  because it cycled through the system
15=10*(1+0.5)
(p37)Why does temperature lower than 20 oC lead to a correction factor higher than 1?->see ppt

改TOU 圖y-axis->OK
 (p42) The main problem arose from the contradiction between low biomass and relatively high oxygen utilization .
1) Could this be caused by the underrepresented meiofauna data? For example, for the cruises with high TOU and BMU (OR1-1219 and -1242), meiofauna was not analyzed.
有可能->meiofauan的資料太少了，但覺得主因不是meio


(p43)Do you mean these numbers were used for both sites as min and max?
yes
(p46) How was "predation (as an export pathway)" modeled?->see ppt
(p46)
1) The analytical procedure of TOC does not differentiate detrital and biotic OC
yes->but we don't have better data?
2) How about adjusting the TOC stock to the same deposition elapsed time?

!(p.49) Why OC only half in GPSC?
(p.51)Lack of megafauna and fish in the food web model or in the field observations? 
both-> no field observation->not included in the model
(p.53)What are "generally accepted values"?
the burial efficiency in other place in the world/ or common used ref

(p59)This one (Pb-210 based) is more like burial rate. Better compare with trap data.


(p60)
The reference value (Pb-210 based estimates) is mostly considered as OC burial flux by geochemists.->yes
(p60)The Pb-210 method measured the average flux over 100-200 years. Traps measured flux over weeks. TOU measured OC flux over hours.The disparity between different methods has been attributed to the Sadler effect.

(p62)"...it would be higher in low disturbance conditions." What is the basis for this?
根據developmental status->發展越高=系統越成熟(演替階段後期)
但GC1長期處於物理擾動中，系統發展=可能一直在演替初期(loop) 但GS1相對的擾動較低發展程度較高

!(p63)The text seems contradictory to earlier arguments. On one hand, OC flux (Pb-210-based estimates) is insufficient to sustain the system. On the other hand, the OC turnover time is decades to a century.
How the sediment OC stock is calculated (integration depth) will strongly affect the turnover time.->yes

(p64)this literature source is still accepted as less strict data  (van Ovelen et al., 2010). 
unclear, why?
因為不是跟採樣同時進行而是文獻裡儘管跟採樣點相近位置(就被認為是lower quality)
